## Deployment Cycle Steps

- Always work on the `dev` branch for changes.
- Create a new branch from `dev`, make changes, and create a pull request (PR) to merge into `dev`.
- Commit approved changes to `dev` cycle, which deploys to Vercel preview environment for testing.
- If changes look good in preview, create PR to merge into `main` branch for production deployment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
